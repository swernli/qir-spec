# Quantum Intermediate Representation: Profiles

A *profile* of a specification is a subset of the specification that defines a
coherent set of functionalities and capabilities that might be offered by a
system. Defining profiles allows a specification to be forward-looking and
expansive while implementations are not yet capable of meeting the full
specification. Profiles also provide a roadmap for implementors by specifying
stages they can progress through that will be useful to consumers of the
specification.

The [under_development](../under_development/) folder includes two initial
profile definitions.
